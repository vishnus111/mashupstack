    <p>Air India Fined Rs 30 Lakh After Passenger, Not Given Wheelchair, Dies

        Air India has been fined ₹ 30 lakh after a 80-year-old passenger died at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport while walking from the plane to the terminal as he was not provided a wheelchair. The incident took place on February 16.
        The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) took swift action, issuing a show-cause notice to Air India, demanding a response within seven days. After reveiwing the response, the regulator found Air India guilty and imposed a fine of ₹ 30 lakh.
        
        The airline said that the passenger's wife had been provided a wheelchair and staff had asked him to wait while they arranged another one. But he instead chose to walk to the terminal with his wife.</p>
